# OShell
Implementation of a shell that reads and evaluates commands given by the user on standard input.
The code is written in c++ and supports:
cd, ls, sleep, exit and etc.
To run the file, you should write: 'g++ shell.cpp -o shell' in your directory, where the file is located. After the compilation is done, write './shell' and Walla! You have your mini shell ready.
